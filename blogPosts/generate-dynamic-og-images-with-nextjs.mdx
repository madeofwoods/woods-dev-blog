# What is an Open Graph image?

**Open Graph** is an internet protocol that provides rules for the sharing of the metadata of a website or page with a third party webpage. This is most commonly seen on social networks, where a link to a site generates a corresponding title, description and image. The image provided is an **OpenGraph image**.

Open Graph (OG) images are an important element in improving website SEO.

# Static Open Graph images in Next 13

The introduction of the App directory with Next.js 13 allowed for a static OG image to be added directly into the <Tag>app</Tag> folder, as well as to any other static page folders.

```md {4, 7}
├── app
│ ├── posts / [slug]
│ ├── about
| | ├── opengraph-image.jpg
│ ├── globals.css
│ ├── page.jsx
│ ├── opengraph-image.jpg
```

The image provided must be called <Tag>opengraph-image.jpg</Tag>.

This is an incredibly efficient and simple way of immediately improving the visibility of your page links. However, sometimes a static image is not sufficient.

# When and why to use dynamic Open Graph images

If you want an OG image which is responsive and dynamically generated from the page content, you will require a dynamic OG image. This would be the case if you have dynamic product pages on an eCommerce site, or in this case, a blog site with dynamically generated blog posts.

This allows for the OG image to be specific to the content of the product page or blog post itself.

# Getting started with dynamic Open Graph images with Next.js 13.3+

This was something of a journey of discovery for me. Due to the rapid development and updating of Next.js, there are various solutions to this problem that are suggested around the internet, as well as in various parts of the Next.js and Vercel documentation.

<List>
  <Item>
    Creating an <Tag>api</Tag> folder in the pages directory - [docs](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation/og-image-examples#using-an-external-dynamic-image)

  </Item>

  <Item>
    Creating the JSX file &nbsp;<Tag>app/pageName/opengraph-image.jsx</Tag> - [docs](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-3#dynamic-open-graph-image-generation)
  </Item>
</List>

The <Tag>api</Tag> documentation is written for the pages directory. So, although I did find an example of a dedicated <Tag>api</Tag> being used within the page folder of the app directory, I decided to pass on that one.

The <Tag>app/pageName/opengraph-image.jsx</Tag> documentation is specifically introduced in the 13.3 release notes, so this felt like the most up-to-date option.

I wanted to create dynamic images for my blog posts, which are generated from the <Tag>app/posts/[slug]</Tag> folder. So, I created the following <Tag>app/posts/[slug]/opengraph-image.jsx</Tag> file.

```jsx:jsx showlinenumbers
import { ImageResponse } from "next/server";

export const size = { width: 1200, height: 680 };
export const contentType = "image/png";

export default function og() {
  return new ImageResponse();
}
```

<Note>
  Before Next 13.3.0 **ImageResponse** was being imported from the package **@vercel/og** which needed to be installed.
  From 13.3.0 **ImageResponse** can be imported from **next/server**. From Next 14.0.0 **ImageResponse** moved from
  **next/server** to **next/og**.
</Note>

The <Tag>ImageResponse</Tag> constructor allows us to generate images using JSX and CSS.

The CSS only works **inline**, and not all CSS properties are permitted. There is a full list of available CSS properties [here](https://github.com/vercel/satori#css).

So, I was easily able to add some consistent elements to my image, that will exist for each blog post.

```jsx:jsx {8-46} showlinenumbers
import { ImageResponse } from "next/server";

export const size = { width: 1200, height: 680 };
export const contentType = "image/png";

export default function og() {
      return new ImageResponse(
    (
        {/* Background -- display flex is required */}
      <div
        style={{
          display: "flex",
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
          color: "white",
          justifyContent: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
          fontSize: "20px",
          position: "relative",
          backgroundColor: "black",
        }}
      >
        {/* Logo */}
        <div style={{ position: "absolute", top: 70, left: 70, display: "flex" }}>
          <div className="logo" style={{ display: "flex", gap: 12, alignItems: "center" }}>
            <div className="square" style={{ width: 27, height: 27, backgroundColor: "white" }}></div>
            <div style={{ fontSize: "22px", letterSpacing: 2, fontWeight: "bold" }}>M A D E O F W O O D S</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        {/* Circle Image */}
        <div
          className="circle"
          style={{
            width: 280,
            height: 280,
            borderRadius: "50%",
            background: "linear-gradient(55deg, hotpink 20%, blue 45% ,aquamarine 86% )",
            position: "absolute",
            top: "50%",
            left: "50%",
            transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)",
            opacity: 0.8,
          }}
        ></div>
      </div>
    )
  );
}

```

# Testing the image output of your OG image

You can find the link to your dynamic OG image in <Tag>meta</Tag> tags of HTML source code. On my local server the <Tag>meta</Tag> tag looks like this:

```HTML
<meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:3000/posts/generate-dynamic-og-images-with-nextjs/opengraph-image?6ccfdc85d4ac399e">
```

Opening the <Tag>og:image</Tag> URL in a new tab shows me what my OG image looks like so far:

<Img alt="static elements added to image" src="/blogs/generateOG/og3.png" />

It is worth noting that Vercel have also created a very useful **OG Image Playground** where you can test out ideas and look at examples.
The playground can be found [here](https://og-playground.vercel.app/).

# Rendering dynamic content to the image

This already looks great to me, but there is nothing dynamic about this yet. This is just a template. If I stopped here, every blog post image would look the same.

In order to make the image feel more bespoke, I decided to add the title of the blog to the image as well.

Dynamic segments, in this case the <Tag>[slug]</Tag> folder name, are passed to the defualt function of <Tag>opengraph-image.jsx</Tag> as the <Tag>params</Tag> prop.

```jsx:jsx {1-3}
export default async function og({ params }) {
    const slug = params.slug;
    const blog = await getBlog(slug);

    return new ImageResponse(
        \\ ...content
    )
}

```

Here, the <Tag>params</Tag> prop is an the object.

```js
{
  slug: "generate-dynamic-og-images-with-nextjs";
}
```

From the slug value, I am able to call the <Tag>getBlog()</Tag> function which returns the <Tag>frontmatter</Tag> and the <Tag>content</Tag> of the blog.
For more context on this I would recommend reading my blog post [Building a blog with Next.js and MDX](http://localhost:3000/posts/building-a-blog-with-nextjs-and-mdx).

Effectively, the <Tag>frontmatter</Tag> that is returned is the following object.

```js
{
    title: 'Generate dynamic Open Graph images with Next.js 13.3+',
    dateString: "2024-01-11"
    topic: "react"
    isPublished: true
    desc: "How to dynamically generate Open Graph images with Next.js 13.3+"
}
```

From this I can now dynamically add any text to the image. I could also add more unique information to the frontmatter to further individualise each the image.
For now, I have stuck with the blog title.

<Tag>ImageResponse</Tag> takes a <Tag>ReactElement</Tag> as its first argument, and an optional second argument where you
can define <Tag>options</Tag>, like the size of your image, along with fonts, emojis and more. Here I have spread the <Tag>
  size
</Tag> object defined in <Tag>line 3</Tag>, to define the width and height of the OG image.

```jsx:jsx {7-8, 49-61, 64-66} showlinenumbers
import { ImageResponse } from "next/server";

export const size = { width: 1200, height: 680 };
export const contentType = "image/png";

export default async function og({ params }) {
    const slug = params.slug;
    const blog = await getBlog(slug);

    return new ImageResponse(
      (
        {/* Background -- display flex is required */}
        <div
          style={{
            display: "flex",
            width: "100%",
            height: "100%",
            color: "white",
            justifyContent: "center",
            alignItems: "center",
            fontSize: "20px",
            position: "relative",
            backgroundColor: "black",
          }}
        >
        {/* Logo */}
          <div style={{ position: "absolute", top: 70, left: 70, display: "flex" }}>
            <div className="blog" style={{ display: "flex", gap: 12, alignItems: "center" }}>
              <div className="square" style={{ width: 27, height: 27, backgroundColor: "white" }}></div>
              <div style={{ fontSize: "22px", letterSpacing: 2, fontWeight: "bold" }}>M A D E O F W O O D S</div>
            </div>
          </div>
        {/* Circle */}
          <div
            className="circle"
            style={{
              width: 280,
              height: 280,
              borderRadius: "50%",
              background: "linear-gradient(55deg, hotpink 20%, blue 45% ,aquamarine 86% )",
              position: "absolute",
              top: "50%",
              left: "50%",
              transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)",
              opacity: 0.8,
            }}
          ></div>
        {/* Blog Title */}
          <h1
            style={{
              fontSize: "37px",
              color: "white",
              padding: "20px 50px",
              position: "absolute",
              top: "72%",
              fontWeight: "bold",
              textTransform: "capitalize",
            }}
          >
            {blog?.frontMatter.title}
          </h1>
        </div>
      ),
      {
        ...size,
      }
    );
  }
}
```

Here is the final result:

<Img alt="dynamic elements added to image" src="/blogs/generateOG/og4.png" />

Should you feel compelled to share this blog on your socials, this image will now appear with the link.
