# Why I Am Starting a Blog

After a month-long hiatus in **Tutorial Hell**, I decided I needed to focus on building again.
Striking the balance between building and learning is an important element of becoming a frontend developer.
A blog, while by no means a unique idea, was the perfect solution to various problems I was facing.

- A blog ecourages me not only to code, but to consider my intentions and justify my choices.
- It requires me to understand the reasons why things work, and to explain them succinctly.
- It gives a voice to the projects I am building each week, as I continue to learn.
- Pertinently, it has given me an excuse to learn Next.js and MDX.

# Why I chose Next

Since the release of **Next.js 13** in October 2022, I was really keen to build a project with this framework. A blog is an excellent candidate for a Next project.
The main advantage of Next 13 for a blog is Server-side Redering (**SSR**). Unlike with a standard React site, which renders pages on the client-side, a Next site will create each page ahead of time on the server-side and send the rendered page to the client.
This is an excellent choice for static sites, like a blog.

A beneficial consequence of SSR is Search Engine Opimization (**SEO**). When your site uses SSR, a search engine can access all the information on your site at the point of crawling.
This is not the case with client-side Rendering (**CSR**), where the information is injected into the **DOM** dynamically.

# Why I chose MDX

It was when I learnt about MDX that things started to get exciting.

MDX is effectively a hybrid of Markdown and JSX, allowing you to use custom React components in your Markdown.

Until building this blog, my only experience with Markdown was in the writing of <Tag>README.md</Tag> files.
Markdown is good choice when making text-based pages, without the need for HTML tags. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid HTML.
The addition of JSX components makes MDX a very powerful language.

This is a code snippet from a hypothetical post:

```md:MDX
Here is MDX in action.

I can make things **bold**.

I can use Custom Components like this Tag component: <Tag>Filename.jsx</Tag>.

I can also list some use cases for MDX:

- this blog
- future blogs
```

And here it is on the page:

Here is MDX in action.

I can make things **bold**.

I can use Custom Components like this Tag component: <Tag>Filename.jsx</Tag>.

I can also list some use cases for MDX:

- this blog
- future blogs

Using MDX with custom components, I am able to build and style my blog freely, without the need to write each blog post as a unique JSX file.
Writing component-based code is at the heart of what I enjoy about React, so MDX is the natural choice for this site.

# Why I chose next-mdx-remote

There were three packages for incorporating MDX into a Next.js project that I considered:

<List>
  <ListItem>
    Vercel's official package:&nbsp;<Tag>@next/mdx</Tag>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    Hashicorp's:&nbsp;<Tag>next-mdx-remote</Tag>
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    Kent C Dodds's:&nbsp;<Tag>next-mdx-bundler</Tag>
  </ListItem>
</List>

To begin with, it seemed that <Tag>@next/mdx</Tag> offered everything that I needed.
Since it is made and maintained by Vercel (the creators of Next.js), it seemed like a natural fit.
However, it doesn't support frontmatter, which I was quite keen to implement.
It also doesn't allow you to store and fetch your MDX files from a database, which felt restrictive.

Both <Tag>next-mdx-remote</Tag> and <Tag>next-mdx-bundler</Tag> support frontmatter and remote data loading.
In the end, I was able to find a wealth of information on how to use <Tag>next-mdx-remote</Tag>,
and the custom component implementation felt natural to me. So, that is the option I went for.

# Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a Markdown add-on that allows you to define key-value pairs at the top of the document.
This is useful for storing _metadata_ for your blog post, within the same file.

<Note>Frontmatter must be placed at the top of the document.</Note>

```md:MDX
---
title: "Building a blog with Next.js and MDX"
dateString: "2023-10-28"
topic: "react"
isPublished: true
---

Main content begins here...
```

To parse the frontmatter, I used a package called [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter).

```js:JS
import matter from "gray-matter";

// blog variable here would be the MDX file from above, for example

const getBlog = (blog) => {

  const { data: frontmatter, content } = matter(blog)

  return {
      frontmatter,
      content
      }
}
```

For context, this is the object returned from <Tag>matter(blog)</Tag>, before destructuring:

```js
{
  content: '\nMain content begins here...\n',
  data: {
    title: 'This is a Title',
    dateString: '2023-10-28',
    topic: 'react',
    isPublished: true
  },
  isEmpty: false,
  excerpt: '',
  orig: Buffer {}
}
```

Using <Tag>gray-matter</Tag> allows me to separate the frontmatter from the main body of the blog.
Using object destructuring, we have the variable <Tag>content</Tag> which contains the main content of the blog, and the variable <Tag>frontmatter</Tag>, which is an object containing the provided key-value pairs.

# Working with next-mdx-remote

I installed the package in the terminal:

<br />

```bash
npm install next-mdx-remote
```

I then imported MDXRemote, which I imported with the <Tag>/rsc</Tag> suffix, because this is in a server component.
I then used the <Tag>getBlog()</Tag> function from before to access my frontmatter, and blog content.

```jsx:jsx
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";

const Blog = ({ blog }) => {
    const { content, frontmatter } = getBlog(blog)

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
            <MDXRemote source={content} />
        </div>
    )
}
```

<Note>
  If you are using an earlier version of Next.js, you have to serialize the content. Serialization is not necessary with
  RSC. For more info, check out the next-mdx-remote
  [documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support).
</Note>

The next step is to prepare the custom components to be passed to MDXRemote.
I can create custom components for simple HTML tags like <Tag>{`<h1>`}</Tag> and <Tag>{`<strong>`}</Tag>.
As well as additional custom components for unique JSX elements, like the info box above or this <Tag>`<Tag>`</Tag> component.

```jsx:jsx
import styles from "./customMDX.module.css";
import { Source_Code_Pro } from "next/font/google";

const sourceCodePro = Source_Code_Pro({ subsets: ["latin"] });

const H1 = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <h1 style={{ fontSize: "32px", color: "#09572a" }}>
      {children}
    </h1>
  );
};

const Strong = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <strong style={{ color: "#074722" }}>
      {children}
    </strong>
  );
};

const Tag = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <span className={`${styles.tag} ${sourceCodePro.className}`}>
      {children}
    </span>
  );
};
```

Once all the custom components have been prepared, they are collected together in an object.
The <Tag>key</Tag> is the HTML tag, or custom tag to be used in the MDX, and the <Tag>value</Tag> is the JSX component.

```jsx:jsx
  export const components = {
    h1: H1,
    strong: Strong,
    Tag: Tag,
  };
```

This <Tag>components</Tag> object can then be passed to the MDXRemote component as a prop.

```diff:JSX showlinenumbers
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";
+ import { components } from "@/components/MDX/CustomComponents";

const Blog = ({ blog }) => {
    const { content, frontmatter } = getBlog(blog)

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
-            <MDXRemote source={content} />
+            <MDXRemote source={content} components={components} />
        </div>
    )
}
```

With this set up, I was able to start writing my blog posts in MDX.
From here, I can continue to create custom components, and add them to the <Tag>components</Tag> object.

# Conclusion

This covers the fundamentals how I wired up my blog. There are, inevitably, additional features that I built or incorporated in the blog.
For example:

- how I implemented code snippets in MDX
- how I built my Table of Contents component

I would probably write separate posts for these features.
For now, there is enough information here for anyone interested to get started with an MDX blog in React.

Looking back at what I have built here, there is a strong argument that I have overengineered my blog.
However, I have learnt a new language along the way, as well as some very useful Javascript packages.
I absolutely would recommend anyone interested in attempting to build something similar.
